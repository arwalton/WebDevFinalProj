      <h1>Large Coursework: Final webpage design</h1>
      <p><strong>Name: </strong>Adam Walton</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong>Introduction: </strong>What is the essential story being told by
        your site and what type of structure did you choose to implement.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        My website is meant as a newsletter and homepage for the group Free Code
        Camp Helsinki (FCC Helsinki). It’s a local group that meets together
        regularly to teach people how to code for free. It has only existed for
        a couple years, but they have already had several of their members with
        no coding experience get good junior developer jobs.<br /><br />The site
        includes a home page, a page with articles about coding topics, a page
        with a weekly coding challenge, a page listing upcoming and previous
        meetups, and a page for job searching.<br /><br />As per the
        requirements, my html pages are all on the top level of the tree and
        none of them are children of the main page. I also have folders for
        scripts, project materials (which only contains attributions right now),
        source (src), and stylesheets.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        <strong
          >State 3 things that have inspired you when creating your website. </strong
        >These could include guest speakers, other websites, artists, developers
        etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>A friend of mine is one of the administrators of FCC Helsinki, and he’s very enthusiastic about the group, but right now all they have is a Facebook page.
          </li>
          <li>I looked at the freecodecamp.org site, and I appreciate the clean, spare design. I tried to replicate some aspects of it in my site design.
          </li>
          <li>I have previously done a lot of coding questions on leetcode.com. The idea for including a question came from my experience on that site.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p><strong>State 3 ways in which your site is accessible. </strong></p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>All images incorporate descriptive alt-text to aid vision-impaired users. The image on the main page that is just decorative has an intentionally empty alt-text, as espoused in W3C web accessibility initiative, while the image on the challenges page has a descriptive alt-text to aid with understanding.</li>
          <li>Most of the written content is dark text on a light background, with a contrast ratio of 15.17:1 according to https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
          </li>
          <li>The site is designed so that keyboard-only users can navigate effectively by tabbing through all items and links. The accordion menu on the challenges page can be opened and closed by tabbing to an item and pressing enter.
          </li>
          <li>All moving content is fully user-controllable, so that users can avoid distraction and sensory overload.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p><strong>State 3 ways in which you have considered usability in your site. </strong></p>
      <p>
        <ol>
          <li>The main menu has both pictures and text for navigation. In addition, I chose not to use a hamburger menu so that the navigation options would be immediately clear to the user.
          </li>
          <li>I incorporated subtle feedback cues to the user when interacting with the site. This shows up in a slight enlarging of the horizontal scroll when it is clicked, as well as space on the sides of the scroll to show that there is additional content. There are also a variety of subtle effects to show when buttons are clicked or different filter options are selected.
          </li>
          <li>I chose to use a relatively conservative design for the site, so that the menus and options are presented in ways that are familiar to a user.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p><strong>State 3 things you had to learn/find out by yourself when creating your site, and describe how you did that </strong>(i.e. what searches you did, any new tools/techniques you learned, any changes/adaptations you made to a particular resource to make it work with your site).</p>
      <br>
      <p>In general, my process was similar for learning how to do new things. I would search online using various keywords, and try to find an example where they do something similar. I also found it useful to add new code one line at a time and use console.log to see what the effect was.
        <ol>
          <li>I had not used the javascript fetch function before this project. I ended up doing a lot of searching for things like “how to parse an rss feed javascript” and variations like that.
          </li>
          <li>Even seeing the videos for using handlebars, I still spent a lot of time searching online for “handlebars basics” and “handlebars examples” in order to help myself understand exactly how to use them.
          </li>
          <li>In CSS, this is a small thing, but I spend a long time trying to create the effect that I wanted on the main page link to the jobs page. I knew that there was a property to let me make the border disappear, and I probably could have just changed the border color, but I ended up reading a lot of information on w3schools about all the different properties, and I found the background-clip: padding-box property that let me get the effect that I wanted.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
      <p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work do you think worked well and why? </strong></p>
      <p>I’m pleased that I was able to get a real rss feed from a site and parse it to display the results. I went through several different solutions, and I’m very happy with how that ended up.

        I also feel like I was able to use handlebars.js effectively to build the website and simplify the html. It is very satisfying to create the objects in js and see them created as functional html.
      </p>
      <p><strong>What aspect(s) of your work could be improved, and how might you do things differently another time? </strong></p>
      <p>In parsing the rss feed, I did something weird so that there is some html that it reads as a string and not as actual html. I think I could fix that bug with a little more time, but it might require doing some more substantial refactoring and re-thinking.

        I’m also not thrilled with how the website looks. I feel like the design process was challenging for me to create something that looks good. It’s definitely functional, but I would have benefited from consulting someone with more design sense and experience.
      </p>

      <p><strong>What resources were used when creating your work? </strong>You should list here any sources of information, libraries, plug-ins or other code that you used to create your site. You should also reference any code you've used by inserting comments at the start of the scripts.
