While they have become much more powerful and sophisticated, computers today operate on many of the same principles as the earliest computers. The idea is to replace the human-like, human-like structure that was once found in the earliest human cell phones which were used today in cell phones. The new structure, known as a "computer supernode", is used within the computers to transfer messages between two computers.

In the end, it looks like this could enable a whole new type of communications on this scale. The supernode can now work in a range of applications including, say, to prevent transmission of information from one person to another. But there are huge obstacles with the system.

A device that works across a group of computers can fail. If the group can't do the same thing on the same computer, it won't work. That means that not all computers operate on a "supernode" and that these computers could be more or less "on top" of each other.

While the new system aims to be small enough to be used in the real world, it'd still take an enormous amount of time and effort to overcome the problems created to bring these systems into operation with all these new electronic devices. Currently, only the "core" supernode in the supernode can work. But there are a lot of different possibilities that could be in play. And what may come first is more complex stuff.
