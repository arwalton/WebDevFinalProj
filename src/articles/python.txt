In a computer world there was never a need for the programmer to manually code on his own.

"There are actually, at least, two kinds of development styles. What you have in the design of software development, and there are other ways to do development in software development, is software development that gives you an understanding of what the programming language is capable of doing and why it might be capable of doing an interesting task. For example, the computer languages of todayâ€”the C language and
