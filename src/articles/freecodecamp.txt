We're not associated with freecodecamp.org, but they offer a ton of resources for learning to code. Go to the links if you're interested - and if you can keep up with their latest releases (or any of their other projects), there's a lot of cool stuff here, lots of learning resources available, and of course an updated API.

What's New in 8.1.3

In today's 8.1.3 release, we're implementing "new" features. These include:

Improved user interface responsiveness

Improved user experience for multiple platforms

Improved search. All of the search functionality is now handled by an app

Removed some of the code that generated the "bump," meaning that some of the code we've used in the past was already done in the app, and no longer exists.

This includes not only the "new" features, but other improvements. Below, I'll try to highlight some of the highlights.

General Improvements

The general feature overhaul in 8.0 is complete. This includes:

Code cleanup and refactoring

A new "bump" to improve code performance at runtime and within all languages

New support for multiple platforms, including Windows 10 (and many more), Mac OS X, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Updated the bug tracker to reflect the changes for 8.0
